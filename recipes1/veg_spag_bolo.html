        <p>These vegan Spaghetti Bolognese will statisfy your tastebuds, while being cruelty free and easy to make!</p>
        <p>For the vegan meat, just use your favorite kind. I like to go with firm tofu crumble and dry spices to marinate.</p>
        <h1>Ingridients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>400g spaghetti</li>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting up your vegetables in fine cubes and mince the garlic. Then set aside and bring one pot of salted water to boil.</li>
            <li>While waiting for the water to start booiling, we begin to fry the meat in a sufficient amount of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add pasta to the boiling water and follow instructions on the packaging. If done earlier than the sauce, strain it  but keep some pasta water and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add Onions to the meat and let the onion get some colour. Add the carrots and garlic. The garlic mustn't burn. </li>
            <li>Incorporate the tomato paste and fry it for a bit to get some roasted aromas.</li>
            <li>Now in goes the wine or the juice and let simmer down for a bit, then add in the tomato passata. </li>
            <li>Season to taste with the spices and add in some pasta water</li>
            <li>Mix up the sauce with the pasta and garnish with the fresh basil and serve warm.</li>
